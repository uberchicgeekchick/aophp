oss-canvas created & aophp apps extended.
	I'm creating my new aophp application 'oss-canvas' for project management & more.  I have also finally 'handed over' support for podcasts & etc to speakingOUT though I still have a ton of work to do for it to fully handle all actions, including generating feeds & etc, for speakingOUT to truly support episodes.  I do know that I have a lot of work to do on aophp to truly start meeting my goals but I am making real progress, if slow, & I'm feeling very proud of what aophp is becoming.  Though I'm far more excited about my work on Alacast which I'll be focusing on in my next programming season.  Which will be in several hours from now, after I get some sleep.  I'd hoped to get to work on Alacast today but my work on refactoring part of connectED's build process.  But I'm happy to finally be making progress on my web app platform.
	What is making me my most productive is so long as I'm creating, being productive, and expressing myself.  Than each day I can at least count on 'talking' in my git commits, its not like having a friend, or more, to talk with.  At least I can rely on it,  So long as with each day I'm productive on some level.
	My life so isn't how I ever would have feared my life would have ended up.  But I can't go there - its an endless pit of dispare & one with no recovery & no way out.  My DNA 'punished' me enough people took it even further, possibly to far, but I'm  still here in some form or another.  And as long as we can keep from thinking about what was, what is, what won't be, & what might be.  If we can just stay away from dwelling on those feelings, memories, fears, & keep my mind from going down those paths.  The better our chances to keep from getting stuck on one of those paths.
