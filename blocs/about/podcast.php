					<em>Expressive Programming</em>, my podcast, focuses on programming as a form of self expression &amp; art.&nbsp; Especially when it comes to coding as a form of free &amp;self expression.&nbsp; Just like one's ability to express themselves should always be free.&nbsp; This is the *free* part of Free &amp; Open Source Software(F&amp;OSS) or any Reciprocal System, Service, Software, or Societies.
