					Welcome to my website &amp; the homepage for my podcast: `Epressive Programming`.&nbsp; `Epressive Programming` is a <a href="http://HackerPublicRadio.Org/">HackerPublicRadio</a> series &amp; produced w/a huge thnx to Enigma.&nbsp; All of the music featured in `ExpressiveProgramming` is by the band Hot.Bitch.Arsenal; their website is <a href="http://HotBitchArsenal.Com/">http://HotBitchArsenal.Com/</a>.

					Producing Perfection?&nbsp; Isn&#039;t possible!&nbsp; So why do we all still hold that as our goal.&nbsp; How high are your standards for yourself?&nbsp; Is there a 'proper' balance?&nbsp; Between trying to be productive &amp; yet being creative &amp; expressive as possible in our programming or any of our creations. Can we accomplish both, can our passions truly become profitable, what is the balance that we each need in our life &amp; our profession?
