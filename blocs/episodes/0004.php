					Is programming, & possibly all creative projects, be used as escapism? For me it was what got me into computer programming. Now today as I try to live with a neuro-muscular disease called DYT+1 Early-Onset Generalized Dystonia I find programming to not only be my truest form of art & self expression. But its also an invaluable way for me to escape from the torment caused by my disease.

I also talk about by further work on my new 3-D game project. I talk about the engine I've chosen & what work I've done so far. Mostly I discuss managing 'non-code resources' of any large project. I especially focus on my game's 3-D models & textures.
