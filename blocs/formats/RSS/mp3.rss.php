			<description><![CDATA[Episode 0003::Now matter what you program, or why, motivation comes into play.&nbsp; But what motivates you?&nbsp; Is it what you'll accomplish once you're done; is it programming itself; is it the benifit, or effect, that your program will bring to others?&nbsp; Is it the money you make or is it something more.&nbsp; Can what we do make our world better?&nbsp; I feel it can on an idividual &amp; global scales.]]></description>

			<link>http://uberChicGeekChick.Com/?episodes=0002</link>
			<description><![CDATA[Episode 0002::Producing Perfection?&nbsp; Isn&#039;t possible!&nbsp; So why do we all still hold that as our goal.&nbsp; How high are your standards for yourself?&nbsp; Is there a 'proper' balance?&nbsp; Between trying to be productive &amp; yet being creative &amp; expressive as possible in our programming or any of our creations. Can we accomplish both, can our passions truly become profitable, what is the balance that we each need in our life &amp; our profession?]]></description>
