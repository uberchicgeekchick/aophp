			<description><![CDATA[<h1>Expressive Programming</h1><h2>Episode 0004::Escapism and Resources.</h2><p>Is programming, & possibly all creative projects, be used as escapism? For me it was what got me into computer programming. Now today as I try to live with a neuro-muscular disease called DYT+1 Early-Onset Generalized Dystonia I find programming to not only be my truest form of art & self expression. But its also an invaluable way for me to escape from the torment caused by my disease.</p><p>I also talk about by further work on my new 3-D game project. I talk about the engine I've chosen & what work I've done so far. Mostly I discuss managing 'non-code resources' of any large project. I especially focus on my game's 3-D models & textures.</p><ul><lh>Links mentioned in this episode:</lh><li><a href='http://www.raydium.org/'>Raydium: 3-D Game Engine</a></li><li><a href='http://blender.org/'>Blender</a></li></ul>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Episode 0003::Now matter what you program, or why, motivation comes into play.&nbsp; But what motivates you?&nbsp; Is it what you'll accomplish once you're done; is it programming itself; is it the benifit, or effect, that your program will bring to others?&nbsp; Is it the money you make or is it something more.&nbsp; Can what we do make our world better?&nbsp; I feel it can on an idividual &amp; global scales.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Episode 0002::Producing Perfection?&nbsp; Isn&#039;t possible!&nbsp; So why do we all still hold that as our goal.&nbsp; How high are your standards for yourself?&nbsp; Is there a 'proper' balance?&nbsp; Between trying to be productive &amp; yet being creative &amp; expressive as possible in our programming or any of our creations. Can we accomplish both, can our passions truly become profitable, what is the balance that we each need in our life &amp; our profession?]]></description>
