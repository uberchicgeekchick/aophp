			This month's episode of Expressive Programming will be delay, perhaps until next month. I'm still working on my many improvements.&nbsp; I'm news & segments focused on my thesis of programming as artistic self expression. I won't release another episode I'm unsatisfied with.&nbsp; If I don't draw a line & finish Expressive Programming's site, segments, news, promos, & etc.</p><p>I need my podcast to be the platform I intend.&nbsp; I have to focus on my web app platform, audio scripts, & snip-its to accomplish this. Sorry for missing an episode. Its more than worth it.</p><p>&amp; last month when I said Expressive Programming was going Ogg only,  I meant it, though I have made another choice as an advocate for <em>freedom, as in liberty &amp; freedom of choice</em>.&nbsp; Next month there will be an OGG Vorbis version & a FLAC.&nbsp; FLAC, WTF?!? for a podcast?&nbsp; yep, like I said the changes will be worth the wait.&nbsp; Will it be worth the bandwidth for FLAC . . . wait &amp; judge when episode 0008 goes live.&nbsp;</p><p>If you feel this is a painfully bad choice for me to make,&nbsp;<em>pretty pleas</em> I can only say, w/all honesty, I truly wish it were.&nbsp; As its not I&#039;ll hope this improvement may lead to the later &amp; many more blissful moments in my future.</p>
