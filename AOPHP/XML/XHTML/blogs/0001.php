				<h1>Urgent: Help the Internet help a helpless friend keep her dreams alive!</h1>
				<h2>Looking for the latest episode of `Expressive Programming`<a href='./?episode=0003'>Episode 0003: Who, what, where, when, why?</a></h2>
				<p>
					One of the truly beautiful things about the Internet has always been its abbility to connect with people from any where in the world.  To be able to get to know others, become friends with them, support each other, &amp; when you need to friends you can lean on.  The 2nd thing that I find most amazing is how the Internet has allowed so many to follow their passions &amp; dreams.  Sadly a friend who helps many do the latter is at risk of loosing the very studio she&#039;s used to bring so much content to so many.  Especially us girl geeks.  Liana Lehau is currently in hospital &amp; while she is just trying to get well her dream may be taken from her.  Podango may close due to no fault of her own while she is unable to do any thing about it.  So its up to us, her friends &amp; fans, she needs us.  So please, we've almost made it, evey dollar helps.  If you have even $2 that you can paypal to help than please.  Let&#039;s come together &amp; keep Podango online.
