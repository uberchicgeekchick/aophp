					I'm an open source artist living with Generalized Dystonia <a href='http://dystonia-dreams.org/about.php'><sup>1</sup></a> & <a href=''><sup>2</sup></a>.&nbsp; I feel coding is one of my main art forms &amp; forms of self expression.
				</p><p>
					Because I live w/GD much, if not most of my life is lived online. I owe my friends here a huge group hug &amp; many many thnx. I'm a ditz so sadly I&#039;ll miss some of you.  But to start w/I must thank: ElizabethN, Davey, scoates, Mighty Mur, cmdln aka Command Line, &amp; many others. I&#039;ve been instructed to sleep so I hope every one some one or some thing, to hold on to. If its only our hope: may we find it! *uberHugs*

					I'm really an uberChick &amp; have my nerd woman brain wrinkles into a lot of everything.&nbsp; Coding/Hacking/Programming/Software Engineering/Etc.&nbsp; My favorite languages include C, PHP, Perl, XML, XLS Family of Languages, CSS, JavaScript, XHTML, RSS, Mono, LUA, &amp;many others.&nbsp; My broad range of interests &amp;talents include graphic, 3D, game, &amp;web design; animation, video, &amp; audio production; writing blogs, essays, &amp; white papers; databases like MySQL, SQLite3, XML/XQuery, &amp; many many many other forms of art.
				</p><p>
					Using my constantly growing array of art tools &amp; canvases.&nbsp; My art works, projects, &amp; creations are constantly growing.&nbsp; &amp; Just like any other <a href='http://uberChicks.Net/'>uberChicks</a>my interests, art forms, &amp; forms of self expression are as limitless as my imagination, motivations, &amp; emotions.&nbsp; Which is a true gift; though I&#039;m still working on embracing all of my aspects, interests, &amp; goals.&nbsp; In a way that will make a true difference.
				</p><p>
					Right now my programming is focused mostly on internet programs.&nbsp; My project that I'm focusing on the most is web/browser based, though not exclusively.&nbsp; Most of my projects are internet based, e.g. XULRunner applications, &not; exclusively web based.
