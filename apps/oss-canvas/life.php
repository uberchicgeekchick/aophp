					I'm an open source artist living with Generalized Dystonia <sup><a href='http://dystonia-dreams.org/about.php'>1</a> & <a href='http://www.dystonia-foundation.org/pages/more_info/61.php'>2</a></sup>.&nbsp; I feel coding is one of my main art forms &amp; forms of self expression.
				</p><p>
					My projects &amp; programming are almost entirely on written in C.&nbsp; I focus on GNOME/GTK+2.0 applications while beginning my new journey as a game programmer.&nbsp; I hope to create multimedia games, platforms, &amp; engines which focus on connecting others, increasing communication, &amp; all while imersing you in environments that will make you think, feel, &amp; even have some fun.
				</p><p>
					My interests, art forms, &amp; forms of self expression are as limitless as my imagination, motivations, &amp; emotions.&nbsp; Which is a true gift; though I&#039;m still working on embracing all of my aspects, interests, &amp; goals.&nbsp; In a way that will make a true difference.&nbsp; My art works, projects, &amp; creations are constantly growing: using my constantly growing array of art tools &amp; canvases.
