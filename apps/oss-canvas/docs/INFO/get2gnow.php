return <<<INFO
get2gnow is my micro-blogging client. It supports multiple accounts on Twitter, Identi.ca, & any Laconica instance.  get2gnow supports accounts on servers using both https & http.  get2gnow supports accessing nearly all data available through Identi.ca&apos;s, Laconica&apos;s, & Twitter&apos;s REST resources.

With micro-blogging becoming an ever increasing way of communicating & connecting with others.  My primary goal, inspiration, & motivation behind  get2gnow is to help any one connect with others online & to be as powerful as your connections are.  And especially to aid users in making new connections.  Specifically I want get2gnow to be the best way to help all users improve their life&apos;s by being the choice way of connecting & communicating with those you&apos;re close to... whether you know them now - and especially to help you make new connections.  There&apos;s a world of people online: get2gnow them!

get2gnow&apos;s goal is to become the very best, most robust, useful, beautiful, and full featured online communication platform imaginable and making it as beautiful, fun, intuitive, accessible, & easy to use as can also be imagined.  One of get2gnow&apos;s primary goals is also to be as accessible as possible & beyond expectations.

get2gnow aims to help you get and do the most on all micro-blogging services, and we want to do it all better, faster, & more beautifully then any other micro-blogging client.  get2gnow wants to be the best online communication platform on any environment, desktop OS or online.  get2gnow &quot;just so happens to be created on and targeted for Linux, GTK+, & GNOME&quot;.

Lastly of special interest to other Linux/GTK/GNOME open source artists, though its not a library now does it provide one, get2gnow can easily be embeddable into other GNOME applications.

I really need a way for bug reports to be easily posted by users and through bugbuddy&apos;s bugreport.txt crash reports.  I truly want get2gnow to be the best program it can be, I want it to become a program worth remembering, and especially to help users get the most out of their online connections.

Whom ever reads this request, please help me to help others connect with yet others.  As a disabled open source artist my online connection are my life line.  Please help me create a cross platform client that will help others improve their life&apos;s by helping to create the best client possible to help other&apos;s make similarly powerful connections.
