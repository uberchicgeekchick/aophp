	return "AOPHP is an aspect oriented PHP web app platform. The system takes an oppinonated software approach where the final object is created & all needed objects are created until the core & final object is created. This is done through interfaces, inheritance, & eventually traits. Right now PHP is the only natively supported language though in the future other languages will be supported. This will happen as I continues to work on my aspect oriented programming layer to C. My working title for this language, compiler, & tools is "Aspects-We-C". It works & compiles similarly to how Vala implement object oriented programming in C. I am still a long way off from having a functional "Aspects-We-C" compiler so for now all I have publicly available is AOPHP. I am working on a lot of features in AOPHP. It requires PHP 5.3 & will soon require PHP 6, as soon as traits are implemented. Far more details on AOPHP can be found by looking at my commit logs than I could possible write here. Especially going forward.";
