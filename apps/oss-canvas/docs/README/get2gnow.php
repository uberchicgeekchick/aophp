get2gnow's a micro-blogging, eg Twitter, Identi.ca, & Laconica, client for GTK+/GNOME.
I'm focused on creating the most full featured online communication client on any platform.
get2gnow just so 'happens' to be exclusively available on Linux, GTK+, & GNOME.
Our goal for get2gnow is to create the very best, most robust, useful, beautiful,
	and feature rich communication platform imaginable.
While remaining straight forward & easy to use.
While making get2gnow easily embeddable into other applications.</pre>";
